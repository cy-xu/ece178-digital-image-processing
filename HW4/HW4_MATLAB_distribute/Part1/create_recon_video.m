function [] = create_recon_video(Recon)
% Your video should display top 100 fourier basis and their corresponding
% reconstructed images. After that display every 10th reconstructed image
% and its basis. Effectively you will get[num = 100+(M*N-100)/10] reconstructed 
% images in the image sequence to be converted to video.
% For creating the video - horizontally concatenate corresponding
% reconstructed images and fourier basis and follow the directions in 
% http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/examples/convert-between-image-sequences-and-video.html#zmw57dd0e6614
% Your function should save the video as 'Image_Recon.mov/avi'.
